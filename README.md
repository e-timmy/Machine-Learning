# Machine-Learning

Slowly but surely my machine learning skills have faded. Here is my attempt at fighting off those fuzzies. Currently, I've only completed a couple of Kaggle competitions as a refresher. For some more advanced, and arguably more impressive moments in my "AI career", check out my university portfolio. There I was blessed with the daemon of skeleton codes and deadlines! \

I'm trying to think about how to expand this, but for the moment, it's Kaggle competitions...

### Kaggle Competitions

- Titanic
  - Source: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview
  - Performance: 0.77511 on test dataset, 8180 out of 16000
  - Best model: minor feature editing, random forest with grid search.
  - To be fair to myself, most submissions by other people would surely constitute cheating, seeing as they've just uploaded the publicly available dataset. I'm not being a snitch.
- Housing
  - Source: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview
  - Performance: 0.14719 on test dataset, 2545 out of 4916
  - Best model: a simple pipeline to impute values, with random forest.
  - I'm working on it!
