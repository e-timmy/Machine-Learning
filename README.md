Slowly but surely my machine learning skills have faded. Here is my attempt at fighting off those fuzzies. Currently, I've only completed a couple of Kaggle competitions as a refresher. For some more advanced, and arguably more impressive moments in my "AI career", check out my university portfolio. There I was blessed with the daemon of skeleton codes and deadlines! \
Trying to think about how to expand this, but for the moment it's Kaggle competitions...
